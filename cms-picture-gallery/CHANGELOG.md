"CMS Picture Gallery" by Shantanu Gadkari

### Log: April 28 2024 (2)
- Renamed "A Journey of Drawings" to "CMS Picture Gallery"
## Initial Log: April 28 2024 (1)
- A place to host the *hundreds* of drawings of mine, drawn from Q3 2020 onwards
- With my knowledge of JavaScript/Angular and hosting on Google Firebase, the original website is 
[Art is Worship] https://art-is-worship.web.app/ 
- The website has a sort of dated appearance, the code is unstructured and undocumented and ... um .. buggy
- As in Q2 2024, the latest version is [A Journey of Drawings] https://journey-of-drawings.web.app/
- This attempts to get in a contemporary, card based look, but lot of work still needs to be done including doing away with the legacy 'carousel' and the previous attempt to  introduce card look
- Thus this new code base.
