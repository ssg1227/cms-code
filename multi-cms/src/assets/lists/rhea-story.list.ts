      '<p>A gray Porche 911 raced into Stevenson Blvd in Fremont and made a sharp right turn into Liberty Street. All the kids dropped their toys and bats, left their tricycles and ran to their homes for safety. A dust cloud followed the car whenever the engine revved up, with random crunching of coke cans and empty water bottles on the street. It appeared as though the car was on a re-entry path from space, not going to stop anywhere, when it suddenly made a sharp 90 degree turn into a drive-way but came to screeching stop with just one inch to spare the garage door. The care rocked back and forth from this sudden braking. All the moms with their kids stood on their drive ways and watched this Nascar show and sighed, “The speed queen has arrived.”</p><br>' +
      '<p>   A few seconds later, the driver’s side door opened and out came a slim leg with high heels. Next, a very fashionable and modern figure in a three piece suit emerged, carrying a laptop, a smart phone and a leather bag full of office documents. The woman, at last, ducked her head and pulled her hand bag from the passenger’s seat and slammed the door shut. The clock, unable to bear the shock, moved forward by a minute and said 6:49. Then there was the ‘tick tack’ of the high-heels for a while, walking on the cement. It stopped when her hand opened the front door which always remained unlocked.</p><br>' +
      '<p> The door was shut behind. Carefully holding all the things in one hand, she removed her high-heels and flung them to one corner of the house. As she was walking towards her room, she could hear the coughing of an old man from the other room. Dropping everything on the table, she went into the kitchen, took out something from the fridge and put it in the microwave. The box said ‘Lean Cuisine’.  After the microwave beeped, she took the food to her room with a drink. When she was about to put the food in the mouth, there was a loud shout from the other room, “Beti, Did you pray to Baba?” Rhea retorts from her room, “Dad, you say work is worship. I have been worshipping my work all day. Allow me to eat in peace.” Rhea flipped through all the channels on the TV and found that there was nothing worth watching. Quickly gulping the food, she started going through all the office papers she had brought home.</p><br>' +
      '<p>     Rhea has a B.S in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA and a MBA from UCLA Anderson School of Management. She worked as a Senior Director of Corporate Loans at Bank of America in San Francisco for many years. She was tired of commuting by BART. She wanted to work some place where she could drive her Porche to work and show off. For the past three years, she has been with C-Gate in Fremont as VP of Finance. She is bright, sharp and clever and she can out-smart you in any conversation. Once, for the Diwali function, at her father’s persistence, she wore a saree. The blouse she wore had a very low back. One of her friends came to her and said, “Rhea, you are a very forward and modern girl exposing so much of your back.” Rhea snapped, “You say, I am forward! I am very backward. I don’t show my front. I insult men by showing my back.”</p><br>' +
      '<p>     Tomorrow is her day. She has made a deal to buy Solar-Indra and their world-class manufacturing facility in Fremont that overlooks 880. She has to be at work by 7:00AM the next day, to be in the conference call with JP Morgan Chase, Citi Bank and Merrill Lynch to close the deal. All the big shots from both C-Gate and Solar-Indra will be there. This will be a major step for Rhea. It will help her realize her life-long ambition to become a Senior VP or CFO of C-Gate.</p><br>' +
      '<p>       The alarm went off at 5:30AM. Hitting the Snooze button Rhea slept for some more time. She got dressed very nicely with fine clothes and showed a ‘little’ to attract the men of power. Sipping a cup of tea, she put all the papers back into the leather bag and got ready to load it into the car. It was a Thursday in winter and it was already late. As she got out of her room, her dad was walking in the hall way chanting ‘Sai Ram, Sai Ram’. He looked at Rhea and said,</p><br>' +
      '<p>“Why do you dress like a street girl?”</p><br>' +
      '<p> “Yes, I am a street girl. Wall Street girl! You don’t know anything about management.”</p><br>' +
      '<p>“Your mom couldn’t manage you. That is why she passed away when you were a teen-ager.”</p><br>' +
      '<p>Rhea had no time to respond. She had to be out of the house soon.</p><br>' +
      '<p>She was racing to get to Kato Road. There was a dense fog and the visibility was just a few feet. The traffic on Dixon Landing was bad due to the BART construction and it had backed up all the way to 880. When she was at the signal on Dixon Landing Road at California Circle, she thought she could make a right at California Circle to bypass the through traffic on Dixon Landing, make it through Milmont Drive and get to Kato Road. This could save a few minutes. So, she quickly made a right turn into California Circle and was speeding as there was no traffic.</p><br>' +
      '<p>                 As she was driving through, she came across a bridge. Right at the bridge, it appeared as though a brown leaf was being blown away by the wind from left to right. She sped through it and suddenly, there was a ‘thud’!    -to be continued</p><br>',

      textContent: '<p>“Oh my God, What did I do?”</p><br>' +
      '<p>Rhea could see a man dressed in white clothes being hit by the car. He was limping and making his way to the walk way on the right.</p><br>' +
      '<p>“Shoot! Who is this idiot? Oh my God, my meeting is finished!”</p><br>' +
      '<p>She stopped the car right there, turned on the emergency blinkers and stepped out to help him.</p><br>' +
      '<p>“Are you OK? Were you hurt badly?</p><br>' +
      '<p>“It is OK. A slight bruise on my right knee and a few drops of blood.”</p><br>' +
      '<p>“Shall I take you to the hospital?”</p><br/><p>“No! No! I don’t want to miss my Arati.”</p><br><p>Rhea’s mind went reeling! “It is not even 7:00AM. He is dating Arati at this hour! I thought I was modern. What has the world come to?”</p></br><p>“OK, I will drop where your Arati is waiting.”</p></br><p>“No, Thank you. I will walk. All this is….(he was choked with emotions) His doing!”</p></br>' +
      '<p>Rhea thought that he didn’t feel safe in her car anymore. As he was walking by, she saw that he was wearing white pants and a white shirt. He was carrying a white back pack, he had his white shoes on his left hand and he was walking bare footed! She couldn’t help notice that in the back pack, something was stuffed in the last minute and it was hanging out of the partly zipped back pocket. The elastic band had a name ‘Jockey’. Rhea couldn’t control herself. She murmured, “Oh My God, The world has changed so much! He is dating Arati and he is carrying extra under garments!” She quickly got back into her car and drove off to work. She thanked her good luck that this didn’t turn into a law suit.</p><br>' +
      '<p>Everything went well with the video conference and the deal was done. Everyone congratulated Rhea on how she had meticulously orchestrated the whole deal. Slowly, everyone left the conference room except for a few. The CEO of C-Gate, Scott Brown patted Rhea on her right shoulder and pulled her to one side and said, “Meet Mr. Hakim. He is the Senior VP of Operations at Solar-Indra.”</p><br>' +
      '<p>Hakim stretched his hand, “I am Hakimrai Jaichand” and shook Rhea’s hand. Rhea replied, “Chandnani, Rhea Chandnani. Nice to meet you!” (Rhea always introduced herself in James Bond style, “Bond, James Bond”). Brown continued, “Hakim will be with us for a few more months before he retires. I want you to spend all the time with him to understand how the factory operates, the machinery, tools, facilities, maintenance, safety, plant drawings etc., so that we can convert it for our operations. Your mechanical engineering skills will become handy now.” Hakim and Rhea agreed that starting next Monday, they would meet at the factory to go over all the details.</p><br>' +
      '<p> The next week, Rhea showed up at the plant at 8:00. It was a huge building which was totally empty of any workers. The company had gone belly-up. All the machines were turned off and it was very quiet. There were only three people….Rhea, Hakim and Steve, a senior technician to help them with any technical issues related to the factory. There was a big office on the second floor with complete glass windows which overlooked the factory floor. One could tell from there what was happening in the factory floor at any given moment. Hakim and Rhea were the lone occupants of this huge office space and Steve was always running errands for them and also to attend to the needs of the building.</p><br>' +
      '<p>Rhea being a gregarious, fashionable and always out-going person, this deafening silence bothered her. But, she has to do it if she wants to climb the corporate ladder. Every day, she would come in at 8:00 and notice that Hakim was already there having brewed the first pot of coffee. She would leave around 5:00 and Hakim would still continue to work. What a dedicated person Hakim must be!</p><br>' +
      '<p> Slowly, they go to know each other. Hakim began to like her company in the office. Rhea was tall 5’ 8”, slim, well dressed with brimming youth and pleasant manners. Hakim came to know that Rhea was not a coffee person. She liked Chai Latte. Sometimes, Hakim would take Rhea to Starbucks on Dixon Landing near Chevron and buy her a Chai Latte and chat on some personal matters. They would go out to lunch together and chat about their experiences in their jobs as well as previous jobs. -to be continued</p><br>'

      textContent: '<p>One day, Rhea left home early around 6:30AM so that she could be there before Hakim. Once again, due to the heavy traffic on Dixon Landing, she took the California Circle to bypass the traffic. As she was driving past BAPS Swami Narayan Mandir on the left, she saw a man, dressed totally in white entering a building on the right. He looked like the same man she had an accident with some time ago. If he was the same person, out of curiosity, she wanted to find out whether he was doing well. As she turned, she noticed a sign ‘SHIRDI SAI PARIVAAR’. She quickly got out of the car and entered the building so that she could meet him before he disappeared into the building. There he was, coming out of the ‘Shoe Room’ bare footed again. Rhea stopped him at the Shoe Room and asked him:</p><br>' +
      '<p>“Do you remember me?”</p></br><p>“Yes. I do..Oh ..that accident!”</p></br><p>“Are you alright after the accident?”</p></br><p>“Yes, I am fine. He takes care of me all the time!” and he pointed towards the idol of Baba in the Main Hall. Rhea looked at the idol of Baba and there were no emotions in her heart. She looked at her watch to see when she can break out of that conversation. The man continued:</p></br>' +
      '<p>“You are in time for Kakad Arati. Would you like to join?”</p></br><p>“Yes!” Rhea wondered as to what made her say ‘Yes’. She continued:</p></br><p>“What is your name?”</p></br><p>“I am Sunil Khare and You?”</p></br><p>“Chandnani. Rhea Chandnani”</p></br><p>“Are you from Mumbai?”</p></br><p>“Yes”</p></br>' +
      '<p>“I am from Mumbai too. We will talk later. Let us go in and have Darshan.”</p><br>' +
      '<p>Rhea followed Sunil like a sheep with a bent head. She was wondering why she has become so obedient to a stranger, almost following his tail. Rhea saw that there were more than 30 people in the early hours of the morning worshipping a marble idol of an old man they lovingly called Baba. There were two brass signs on the wall inscribed ‘Faith’ and ‘Patience’. Rhea froze and stood still like a pillar. There was an aura of peace and tranquility, though the speakers were blasting off with some songs accompanied by drums which she could not understand. They were pouring water on the idol, wiping and dressing the idol etc. At some point, all the women were called to hold a plate with 5 lamps to wave it in front of Baba. She did that ritual and came out. She looked at her watch, it was already 8:15! She thought, “What am I doing here?” Just then, Sunil came to her, took her to the kitchen so that she can eat something before leaving the place.  Rhea asked Sunil:</p><br>' +
      '<p>She stopped the car right there, turned on the emergency blinkers and stepped out to help him.</p><br>' +
      '<p>“When can I meet you again?”</p><br><p>“Same time, same place every day. If we have to meet again, He will make it happen”</p><br><p>Rhea waved at Sunil and dashed off to work. She was wondering who is ‘He’?</p><br>' +
      '<p>  Months rolled by. One day, during lunch, Rhea asked Hakim as to how he is could work such long hours. This hit Hakim very hard at his heart.  He said, “Rhea, I am sorry to share this with you. I am divorced. I have nothing else to do. I am tired of playing golf all the time. My two daughters are married and well settled. My ex-wife is in Seattle. I have a retirement home in Phoenix. I am currently renting a place in Milpitas. Once I retire from here, I go straight to Phoenix and see how long I can sustain myself in that house, all alone. I don’t have any friends in Phoenix. Also, at my age, it is difficult to find people who have similar interests.” Rhea felt sorry that her question exposed the sad side of Hakim.</p><br>' +
      '<p> Rhea learnt a lot from Hakim during the three months she was with him in the factory.  Both had developed a 420 page document that showed the plan as to which tools they have to keep, which tools they have to sell and which tools they have to buy and install so that they can turn the factory to make C-Gate’s products. It was now time for Hakim to retire as his last Friday was coming up. Rhea wanted to take him to dinner and bid him farewell. She had chosen a very nice Italian restaurant in San Jose.</p></br>' +
      '<p> Hakim drove her to the restaurant and they both enjoyed the fine Italian spirits and the gourmet Italian cuisine. Hakim said that he feels very lonely because the only thing that he was holding onto was his job and it is also gone now. He has to transition now into retirement.  He said that he needed a week to clean up and vacate his apartment and that would make him even more miserable. Rhea could see the slight tears in his eyes and she felt sorry for him. Hakim then held Rhea’s both hands and said, “Rhea, I have got to know you during the past three months. You are a very smart and intelligent girl and you can pick up things very quickly and become good at it. You are an asset to C-Gate. I will talk to Scott Brown and strongly recommend that you be promoted to Senior VP of Operations and Finance. But, I need a small favor from you. You helped me clean up the Solar-Indra facility. Can you please stay with me for one week to help with packing and clean-up? Will you please help me with my transition to retirement?” -to be continued</p><br>',

            textHeader: 'The Wonderful Story of Rhea - Part 4',
      textContent: '<p>Rhea was suddenly taken aback. She could quickly sense an evil motive in Hakim’s request. Though many top executives had flirted with her once in a while, nobody had made such bold advances. She thought to herself, “Hakim will recommend me for promotion only if I help him with his lonely transition. Otherwise, he wouldn’t recommend me. What about all the hard work that I have put in for the past three months? He wants a personal favor from me to help my career. How mean can he be?”</p><br>' +
      '<p> Rhea cut short the conversation and told Hakim that she had to go home immediately to take care her father because it was getting late for his medications. She didn’t want to take a ride from Hakim. Instead, she called a cab, went straight to work, picked up her car went home. It was a restless night. Somehow Hakim’s actions bothered her to the root. She wanted to talk to someone about it and let off her steam. Rhea didn’t have any close friends with whom she could confide.The only person that came to her mind was Sunil Khare whom she met last at the temple. “How to call him, text him or email him? I don’t have his contact info.” so thought Rhea. The best way to reach him is to go the Shirdi temple and wait for him. Somehow, due to the mental agony, fatigueand tiredness she dozed off a little in the early morning hours.</p><br>' +
      '<p> It was a Saturday and that was her sleep-in day. Yet, she got up early and was at the Shirdi temple parking lot at 6:15AM waiting for Sunil to show up. Several cars pulled in, people gotout and entered the temple. Rhea was becoming impatient. At about 6:30, a white Toyota Corolla came in fully loaded with clothes, blanket, pillow, comforter, tiny table lamp,a laptop computer, a few books and other stuff. Slowly the door opened and out came Sunil walking towards the temple entrance. Rhea quickly went to the entrance, stopped him and shouted,</p><br>' +
      '<p>“Sunil, I want to talk to you. It is urgent!” Sunilwas surprised to see her after a long time.</p></br><p>“Rhea, how are you? It has been a long time! Sure, we can talk. What is urgent now is to have Baba’s darshan. After the Arati, we can talk at length. Whatever is bothering you will vanish if you pray to Baba.”</p></br><p>Rhea felt somewhat snubbed at his response but she had no other recourse.  All these days, she didn’t believe in God or Baba but now, she was forced to pray for His help. As she begged Baba to resolve her problem, she was choked with emotions. After the final Arati at 8:00, Sunil and Rhea took the Prasadam in the kitchen. Rhea said:</p></br><p>“Shall we talk now?”</p></br><p>“Not here. Let us go outside. It looks like it is something personal.”</p></br>' +
      '<p>Both were standing near Rhea’s car and Rhea poured her heart out to Sunil of everything that happened at work since the car accident. Sunil was a passive listener. He never said anything. Just then, it began to drizzle and Rhea asked Sunil to sit in the passenger’s side of the car. The car was filled fashion magazines, brochures and catalogs of women’s fine clothing and intimate apparel, perfumes, scarves, shopping bags from Victoria’s Secret and Ann Taylor, different colored shoes and watch bands,handbags, credit card statements etc. Sunil felt rather uneasy to sit in a woman’s car but he had no choice and he sat silently. Unable to bear his silence, Rhea blurted angrily:</p></br>' +
      '<p>“So, Sunil, you have nothing to say after all that I have told you?”</p><br><p>“Rhea, I don’t know you that well. I was hesitating how to say this to you! You have placed your career as number one, personal fitness and beauty as number two, fashion/luxury as number three, professional contacts as number four, your personal life at the very bottom and there is no place for spirituality. Spirituality is the foundation of humanity and since you don’t have it, everything has crumbled. Now, you are asking me to comfort you!”</p><br><p>“What is wrong in aspiring for the highest position in any organization?”</p><br><p>“There is nothing wrong, but it has to be supported by a strong foundation of spirituality so that you can stay in that position for long. If your ego is driving you to aspire for that position, then the down fall is imminent.”</p><br><p>“Shut up Sunil! You talk like a saint! Are you telling me that your career goals were all based on spirituality?”</p><br>' +
      '<p>“Will you allow me to talk without being rude?”</p><br><p>“I am so sorry! I hardly know you, yet I am taking the liberty to scream at you!”</p></br>' +
      '<p>“Many years ago, I was working for Cisco in the Finance department. I repeatedly kept on telling the management, ‘the Company financesare not looking good.’ One day, there was a major layoff and I was one of them. Then, I joined a small start-up Fiasco (Financial Investment Advisors and Services Corp) and did very well. After many years, the CEO resigned and I took over the company and made it highly profitable. I sold the company to Merrill Lynch and made many millions. I could have bought a home, got married and settled down. Instead, I became greedy for money. I started my own Financial Services Company thinking that I could double or even triple my investment. This is when I failed. I lost all of it.….<br> To be continued</p>'

            textHeader: 'The Wonderful Story of Rhea - Part 5',
      textContent: '<p>“What happened next?”</p><br><p>“Even then, I didn’t learn a lesson. My ego and arrogance kept on pushing me to start another venture to recoup the loss. I borrowed money from my friends and started another company. Again, luck was not in my favor. I was totally broke. Some of my friends who were not married, allowed me to stay with them for a while but when they got married, I was booted out. I became a homeless person.”</p><br><p>“So, that made you spiritual?”</p><br><p>“No. I lost my father when I was ten and my mother brought me up. I was the only child. Since we were always struggling to make both ends meet, I understood the importance of money and craved for it. Just when I became homeless, I got the news that my mother was seriously ill. I had to borrow money from my friends to go to India to see her. She passed away within a few days of my arrival. I could not do any elaborate arrangements for her cremation. At my mother’s funeral, I met a person who was a devotee of Sri Sathya Sai Baba of Puttaparthi. He suggested that I go to Puttaparthi and have Baba’s darshan so that it could help me straighten my life. After I had His darshan, my whole life changed and I understood the real meaning of life. My greed for money disappeared once and for all and I became spiritual.”</p><br><p>“If you don’t have a home, where do you live?”</p><br>' +
      '<p>“Didn’t you see my white 1982 Toyota Corolla filled with stuff? That is all that I have. If I can’t find a place to stay overnight in a homeless shelter, then I sleep in my car. Rest rooms in some temples have a shower and make use of it when necessary. My breakfast, lunch and dinner are made up of prasadams from various temples and Gurudwaras. My needs are very little.”</p><br>' +
      '<p>“I find it hard to believe. You look good, clean shaven, nicely dressed and well groomed. Why were you crossing the road near the Penitencia Creek Bridge with bare foot when my car hit you?”</p><br><p>“Oh, that is a long story. I had given my car for service at Piercey Toyota in Milpitas. They promised that the car will be ready in the evening. When I went there, the Service person said that there were problems with the brakes and I have to leave the car with him for one more day. With nowhere to go, I walked from there to the Milpitas Shirdi temple for Dhup and Shej Arati. After the Shej Arati, I was wondering where to spend the night. Just then a devotee couple who had come for the Shej Arati, noticed my aimless wanderings in the temple premises. They asked me whether I needed any help. First I said I didn’t need any help, yet they insisted. I told them that I have no place to spend the night. The husband and wife were very nice. They told me that I could spend the night in their house. Their house is walkable distance from the temple, on the other side of Coyote Creek Bridge on Elkwood Drive. I told them that I will be leaving early to attend the Kakad Arati. They said to leave quietly without making noise. I had a quick shower, changed my clothes, held my shoes in my hand and walked quietly bare-footed to cross the bridge to reach the temple. You know what all happened after that.”</p><br>' +
      '<p>“Now I know why you were carrying your old clothes in your back pack that morning. Sunil, are you not interested in finding a job?”</p><br/>' +
      '<p>“You think I am not looking? Unfortunately, the Silicon Valley is flooded with software engineers, and finding a regular job is not that easy. I do many contract jobs that last for a few months. Without a steady job and a good bank balance, it is difficult to rent an apartment in this area.”</p><br/>' +
      '<p>“Sunil, you have been very nice to me and you have hammered some sense into my head. What can I do for you? Would you like to stay in my house till your job situation gets better?”</p></br>' +
      '<p>“Rhea, it is very kind of you to make me that offer. Somehow, I have been away from women all along. My only weakness was money and I am out of it now. Somehow, I have learnt to keep ‘woman and money’ away. I don’t want to go back on that path again.”</p></br>' +
      '<p>“Sunil, I understand your point. Yet, I want to give you something in return for all the help you have given me. Tell me what I can do for you?”</p><br>' +
      '<p>“Rhea, please listen to me carefully. When you go to orthodox temples in India for worship, they ask men to remove their shirt, the inner T-shirt (banyan), belt and bare their chests. Some temples even ask men to remove their pants, wallets and wear a Dhoti. Women are supposed to be fully covered, head-to-toe with a saree. In this country, when you go to a temple for worship, men are fully covered, whereas many women show off, thinking they are cultured, civilized, graceful and sophisticated. Today is a holiday and you came to me for advice. What is the need to have such a flashy dress for visiting a temple as if you are going for an Oscar award? Instead of spending hundreds of dollars for designer clothes, dress moderately and use the money saved to feed the hungry, poor and the homeless. When you dress temptingly and invitingly, you can expect problems. When you dress conservatively, people respect you and stay at arms-length even while speaking to you. For men, tie is a neck wear. For women, Duppatta is not a neck wear. Let your dress be one step behind the latest fashions.”</p></br>' +
      '<p>“You are very selfish. You only make contacts with people who can help you in your career or do favors for you. Even when you spend time with them, you always keep thinking of ROI (Return on Investment), Preservation of Capital etc. Give up such expectations and let your friendship be genuine and come from your heart.”</p><br>' +
      '<p>“Next, believe in God and pray to him whole heartedly to free you from the greed for worldly objects. When the greed goes down, compassion and love will blossom in your heart. Then your face will shine, radiate peace and people will be attracted to you naturally, not because of you are beautiful and attractive. Respect the elders and engage in some volunteering activity to make up for the time you have wasted so far in your life.”<br/>…… to be continued</p></br>',

            textHeader: 'The Wonderful Story of Rhea - Conclusion',
      textContent: '<p>“Sunil, it is all a wonderful piece of advice. Service to the poor is a good thing to do.  Let me think about it before I launch into volunteering.”</p></br>' +
      '<p>“Rhea, the moment a noble thought occurs in your mind, you must put it into action right away. If you procrastinate, it will go away. The drizzle that we had a moment ago was a blessing from Baba that you are turning towards God. Look, it is only 9:30. The San Mateo Homeless Shelter is looking for people to sponsor lunch today. On Saturdays, there are about 20 women and a few men waiting for lunch. We can buy some Pizzas and soft drinks on the way and serve them lunch. Why don’t you go home, get dressed in some simple clothes and come back. I will be waiting for you here, at the temple. We will both go and feed the hungry today. What do you say?”</p><br>' +
      '<p>“Sunil, it is a good idea. Let me go home, change and come back quickly.”</p><br/><p>“Good, good! Don’t change your mind!” Sunil got out of the car and waited for her in his 1982 Corolla.</p></br>' +
      '<p>Rhea was serving the Pizza and Sunil was handing out soft drink cans. As they received the food from Rhea, many people said, “May God Bless you!” “May you and your family be happy!”At those moments, Rhea’s eyes moistened and something choked her throat. She had never seen so much of poverty in an affluent part of California. She really felt sad that she has squandered away all her money whereas these people didn’t have even some money to buy food. After lunch, Sunil introduced some of the women to Rhea. Rhea had a heart-to-heart conversation with them. Some of them were well educated professionals but fate had its way on them. She comforted and consoled them. All of them thanked her for taking the time to come and serve them. While they were talking, Sunil had quietly gone out and had bought several boxes of cookies. He prepared some hot tea in the kitchen and served them with cookies and tea. Everyone enjoyed the hospitality. The conversation continued till 4:00PM. Sunil and Rhea took leave of them and started walking towards to the parking lot. Sunil broke the silence.</p><br>' +
      '<p>“Rhea, let this not be your first and last service to the poor. There are homeless shelters in Fremont, Milpitas, San Jose, Sunnyvale etc. Call them several weeks before and schedule your service for every weekend at different shelters. When you do service regularly, you will be surprised to find that you will become ‘rich’ and your life too will become ‘rich’. Once in a while, you will be able to spot me in one of the shelters. Do you get the picture?”</p><br>' +
      '<p>Rhea was contemplating on Sunil’s words and could not fully fathom the meaning.</p><br/><p>Sunil asked Rhea, “You haven’t told me anything about your family!”</p><br/><p>“I am the only child and I am single. My mother passed away when I was thirteen. My father lives with me. He is a stick in the mud and he has his old ways.”</p><br/><p>“Don’t talk badly about your father. You have met me because of your father!”</p><br/><p>“You know him?”</p><br/><p>“Yes. We have known each other for ages! When you go home, please tell him that I have responded to his request. I hope you will continue to feed the homeless.” So saying, Sunil sped off in his car.</p><br>' +
      '<p> When Rhea made a right turn from Stevenson Blvd into Liberty Street, the car was going very slowly. The kids who were playing stopped and watched her in wonder. She stopped in the middle of the road, lowered the window, talked to a few kids and even squeezed the cheek of a young boy with love! All the moms who were watching this from their drive-ways shouted in unison, “The Divine queen has arrived.”</p><br>' +
      '<p>As Rhea entered the house, she saw her father coming out of the corner where he used to pray to Baba. Seeing her in a saree he asked, “Was there a party?”</p><br/><p>“No. I went to Costco to buy Pizza for the homeless.”</p><br/><p>“Wearing a saree?”</p><br/><p>“Dad, I met a homeless person, Sunil. I love him very much.”</p><br/><p>“Sai Raaam, Sai Raaam! I don’t like where this is going! Please don’t tell me that you want to marry him.”</p><br/><p>“Nah, Nah! Sunil said, ‘He has responded to your request.’ Do you know him?”</p><br/><p>“How does he look?”</p><br/><p>“Wears a white dress, carries a white bag containing his belongings and talks high philosophy.”</p><br>' +
      '<p> Rhea’s father stood still for a minute thinking who that person could be?… Sunil… it doesn’t ring a bell….. Suddenly, his lips quivered and began to sob like a child. Rhea quickly hugged him and comforted him. After gaining composure, he spoke:</p><br><p>“Rhea, my dear child! I have been praying to Baba for many, many years asking Him to put some sense into your head. Seeing how you were behaving, I had given up all hope. Finally, He has come in the form of Sunil and answered my prayers. How loving He is! Baba used to say, ‘If wealth is used only for personal enjoyment, it is wasted.’ He works in very mysterious ways.</p><br><p>He says,‘I bring men to Me from long distances and many places. I seek them and bring them to Me. They do not come of their own accord… I bring them to Me!’</p><br>' +
      '<p> I have been praying to Him since I was a teen-ager. Yet, He did not give me His vision. You never believed in God, yet, He gave you His Divine vision! How merciful is He! You were able to see Him, talk to Him, seek guidance from Him and worked together with Him and fed the poor. What else one can you ask for in this birth? Beti…. you are indeed blessed! Really blessed! (He chokes) Look at me, “I must have been a sinner in my past life!”, and he burst into tears.</p><br>' +
      '<p>Tears welled up in Rhea’s eyes and she immediately fell at her father’s feet for the very first time and asked him to pardon all her mistakes and negligence towards her father. She said, “Dad, because of your prayers, I have been transformed. I have now realized that name, fame, position, wealth and money are not important in life. I promise you that I will take good care of you from now on, and you won’t feel like a neglected person in this house. Please forgive me, Dad.”<br/>' +
               '“Beti, get up and ask for forgiveness from Baba. Always keep chanting ‘Sai Ram Sai Ram’ because we don’t know when we will err and go in wrong ways. I am so happy today because, you are not only my daughter but you have become Baba’s daughter too!”  <br/><br/>' +
               '“By the way, how did you meet Sunil?”<br/>“Accidentally!”</p><br>' +
               '<p> On Monday, before going to work, Rhea stopped at the Shirdi temple to have Baba’s darshan.  She was looking for Sunil. She asked someone in the temple,</p><br>' +
               '<p>“Excuse me! I am looking for a homeless person by name Sunil who comes in the mornings.”</p><br>' +
               '<p>The person was somewhat perplexed at this question and out came the reply:</p><br>' +
               '<p>“We do not know of any homeless person by name Sunil. We only know of one Sunil who comes on weekend mornings but he has a home.”</p><br>' +
               '<p>Rhea remembered her father’s remark, ‘He works in very mysterious ways!’<br/><h5>Jai Sai Ram</h5>'
