      textContent: `<p>The story of birth of the Lord, a saint, a prophet or a messenger of God is always very beautiful, completely absorbing and spiritually elevating. 
                Out of all the incarnations, the birth of Sri Krishna is the most beautiful one. This is because He personifies Pure Love. Man has an element of Love in him and it is easy to connect with the Lord who is pure, unsullied Love. 
                Divided into seven parys, is this narration of the wonderful story of Sri Krishna’s birth as told in Srimad Bhagavatam (This is not Bhagavad Gita). Why seven days? King Parikshith listened to the stories of Krishna for seven days and achieved Moksha (liberation). It is said that if you read Sri Sai Satcharitra for seven days all your wishes will come true. Seven is a magical number! There are seven sages (saptha rishi), the are seven hills (saptha giri), there are seven notes (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Da, Ni: saptha swara), there are seven seas (saptha samudram). 
                Seven days of constantly remembering the Lord quickly leads to self-realization. There is even a brand of fast food called ‘777’. You all know about ‘Seven Eleven’!</p>
                <p>Bhagavatam narrates the experiences of those devotees who have come in contact with God (Bhagavan + Bhakta = Bhagavatam).  Reading Bhagavatam cures physical, mental and spiritual illnesses. Listening to it promotes the realization of God.<p/>

      '<h6>Background and Setting the stage</h6>' +

      '<p>Pandavas (five in number) go to war with Kauravas (100 in number) after 13 years, to regain the kingdom they lost in a game of dice. Out of the five Pandavas,  Arjuna and Yudhistra (also known as Dharma Raja) play a very important role in the story of Mahabharata. Lord Sri Krishna becomes the Arjuna’s charioteer. On the Kaurava side,  Dronacharya, the Guru and the Master of Archery and his son Ashwatthama, play an important role. Dronacharya is very much attached to his only son Ashwatthama, treats him as his life breath and protects him as eyelids protect the eye.</p>' +

      '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;During the war, it becomes impossible for the Pandavas to kill Dronacharya as he is invincible due to his mastery of archery. In the war, there was an elephant by name Ashwatthama which gets killed. Krishna asks Yudhistra to say loudly that “Ashwatthama is killed” and followed by “the elephant” softly. Just when Yudhistra completes saying “Ashwatthama is killed”, Krishna blows the conch loudly that the words “the elephant” is not at all heard.  Hearing that Ashwatthama is killed, Dronacharya thinks that his son is killed in the war and he loses his hold on the bow. The bow falls to the ground. At this time, Arjuna sends an arrow and kills Dronacharya. Also, Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna, gets killed by Kauravas when they cleverly surround him from all sides.</p>' +

      '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war was over, when Ashwatthama comes to know about the foul play by which his father Dronacharya was killed, he decides to take revenge by killing all the descendants of Pandavas.  Abhimanyu’s wife Uttara was pregnant at that time. Ashwatthama goes to the house of Abhimanyu and shoots an arrow at Uttara’s womb. But, mysteriously, a spinning wheel comes and grinds the arrow to pieces. Uttara with her fetus was saved. An interesting story begins to develop from here. Please wait for the next installment!.</p>',

      '<p>The embryo, growing in the womb of Uttara,  saw a sharp arrow let off by Aswatthama (Drona’s son) flying towards him, emitting sparks of fury and terror, bent on his destruction. But, at that very moment, he also saw a Person of Brilliant Charm armed with a Terrific Wheel, breaking that death-dealing arrow into a hundred pieces. The royal fetus was filled with wonder and gratitude.</p>' + '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The fetus pondered deeply on the identity of the savior. “Who is he? He must be dwelling with me in this womb. Otherwise, how could he see the arrow at the very moment I saw it? He has a dexterous skill that he could destroy it before it reached me. Can he be my uterine brother? How could he get hold of that wheel? If he is endowed with a wheel, how did I miss having it? No, he is not a mortal. He is Divine.” Thus he grew in the womb, contemplating on that Form.  At the end of the period of gestation, he was born into the world with strange splendor. The child too was very bright; it seemed to watch the lineaments of everyone who fondled it or came before it. It stared into their faces very longingly and lovingly. All were surprised at this strange behavior. Every person who came to it was subjected to this searching examination by the child who seemed determined to trace someone or something, in the world into which it was born. The fact remained that the child was examining all, for some trait or sign which it knew already, and recognize the Form it had in mind. “Pariksha” was the word used by every one for the “quest” the child was engaged in. So, even before the formal naming ceremony, everyone was referring to the child as Parikshith (the one who is enagaged in Pariksha) and the name stayed.</p>' +
      '<p>The child was growing bigger every day and  Subhadra (Krishna’s sister) and Uttara were rejoicing watching the frolics of the child. Meanwhile, Yudhistra (Dharama Raja) consulted the court priest and set an auspicious day for the naming ceremony of the child. Invitations were sent to Kings, Rulers, Scholars, Pundits and prominent citizens. Arjuna went to Sri Krishna and reverentially prayed that He should shower His grace on the child on this occasion. He succeeded in bringing Krishna along when he returned. Sahadeva (one of the Pandavas) a took the child and placed it on a bed of flowers in the Mantap that was erected for the naming ceremony. But, the child rose on all fours and started crawling bravely in spite of the remonstrance of the maids. Apparently, the child wanted to proceed somewhere!</p>' +
      
                      '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The efforts of Sahadeva to stop its journey proved futile. Yudhistra, who was observing its movements with interest said with a smile, “Sahadeva! Do not stand in the way. Leave him alone. Let us see what he does”. The child soon made a bee-line towards the place where Lord Krishna was seated, as if He was a long acquaintance whom he was longing to meet. The child grasped the feet of Krishna and pleaded by his looks, that he may be taken on the lap and fondled.</p>' +
      
                      '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Krishna saw his yearning. He laughed aloud! He graciously bent low and lifted the child on to His lap. Sitting on His lap, the prince was staring at the Lord’s face without even a wink; he did not turn his head this way or that. He just sat and stared. Everyone was amazed at this behavior, so unlike that of a child. Sri Krishna turned to Yudhistra and said, “This fellow has started examining even Me! Well, I must test his behavior a little”. Then the Lord tried to distract the attention of the child by placing a variety of toys in front of him and hiding Himself from the view. But, his attention was not drawn towards any object. He had his eyes fixed inexorably on the Lord and he was seeking the Lord always! Krishna declared, “This is no ordinary child. So, Parikshith is the most appropriate name for him”. At this point, the Brahmins recited relevant passages from the Vedas and women sang auspicious songs. The family preceptor dipped a Navaratna (nine-gem) jewel in honey and wrote the name on the tongue of the child and the naming ceremony came to a happy end.</p>' +
      
                      '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Krishna stayed with the Pandavas for several months after the ceremony. The Pandavas enjoyed the intimacy with Krishna and benefited immensely from the Lord’s teachings every day. Finally, Krishna decided to go back to Dwaraka. Arjuna also decided to go with Krishna to Dwaraka to give Him company during the long journey, assure His safety and then return to Hastinapura. But, Arjuna does not return to Hastinapura for a very long time!',

      '<p>It has been a very long time since Arjuna left along with Lord Krishna to Dwaraka and there was no information from him about his whereabouts.  The Pandavas and mother Kunti were getting worried. Yudhistra’s face was becoming pale with anxiety and constant agitation. Day by day, his face was becoming dimmer and dimmer and he was sinking in agony. Dharmaraja (Yudhistra) told his brothers, “I see ominous things all around. I see only inauspiciousness, ill-fortune and negation of joy. I thought this was my imagination due to my sadness and anxiety. But, I could not succeed and muster up courage and confidence.”</p>' +
      '<p>“To make things worse, I saw some scenes that are contrary to established morals and Dharma. The Courts of Justice in this kingdom have been receiving petitions and pleas regarding wrongs, injustices and misdeeds which make me grieve deeply. I saw some situations which were even worse. Last evening, I saw a mother cow refusing  to nurse and feed her new-born calf! This is quite strange and contrary to nature. I saw some women wantonly loitering in the bazaar. I hoped that they would rush into their homes when they saw me; No. Instead, they started staring at me. They had no reverence for authority. They went on as if I was not in the picture. They continued to talk without restraint to the menfolk. I saw all this with my own eyes. I simply proceeded from that horrid place.”</p>' +
      '<p>“Very near the Raja Bhavan, when I was about to enter, I saw a Brahmin selling milk and curds! I saw people emerging out of their houses and closing the doors behind them. I found them fixing an iron thing to the doors so that it can’t be opened. (They were locking the doors for fear of thieves.) My mind was very much concerned with all these tragic transformations.”</p>' +
      '<p>“For, how else are we to explain such a fact as this: a wife quarreled with her husband and is arguing before the judge in court that she should be permitted to go to her parents, leaving him to himself. How I am to face such a plea in court that she should be permitted to dissolve the marriage and leave for her parent’s home, deserting her husband? A petition from such a wife was admitted yesterday in the Court of Justice! How am I to ignore such disgraces?”</p>' +
      '<p>“Yesterday, the horses in the royal stables started weeping. They were shedding copious tears, the workers in the stables reported. These are the indications of wholesale destruction, not of any minor danger or small evil.”</p>' +
      '<p>Meanwhile, a guard from the main entrance rushed in, announcing that the soldiers had spotted Arjuna approaching the outskirts of the city.</p>',

      textContent: '<p>Arjuna was walking briskly and he was quickly approaching the Royal apartment. Everyone rose as if they had suddenly come to life; they hurried forward to meet Arjuna, thirsty for the news from Dwaraka. Arjuna came in, depressed and despondent devoid of any joy. Without looking at anyone, he fell at the feet of Dharmaraja and tears started streaming from Arjuna’s eyes. Nobody had the courage to ask Arjuna about the happenings in Dwaraka.</p>' +
      '<p>Dharmaraja mustered some courage and asked Arjuna in pathetic tone, “Have you any news about Lord Krishna and the Yadavas?” Arjuna with sobbing eyes said, “Brother, Sri Krishna has departed from this world. The Yadavas left the world even before news came of His departure.”</p>' +
      '<p>At this Dhramaraja exclaimed, “Hari, Hari, O God! What is it that you said now? What a catastrophe? I do not understand anything.” Dharmaraja hugged Arjuna and sobbed. All the Pandava brothers were thrown into deep sorrow. He continued, “The Lord causes beings to create beings and He causes beings to end beings. Bodies get born, bodies die. Nothing more happens at birth or death. This has been taught to us by Vaasudeva (Krishna).”</p>' +
      '<p>Hearing what had happened to Krishna, mother Kunti fainted and breathed last. Dharmaraja and Arjuna felt that there is no point in living in this world when the Lord has left the earth. Bhima, Nakula and Sahadeva also had the same feeling.  They all decided to go the Himalayas and work towards their salvation. But, somebody has to hold the reigns of the kingdom. The young boy Parikshith is the only crown prince who has to shoulder the responsibilities of managing the kingdom.</p>' +
      '<p>Dharmaraja called renowned astrologers and asked them, “O wise men, who know the past, present and future! Examine the horoscope of Parikshith and tell me how the future will be shaped.” The Pundits examined the horoscope at length and the head Pundit stood up and addressed King Yudhistra, “Maharaja, I have examined thousands of horoscopes, but I never yet to come across a more auspicious grouping than is indicated in this horoscope. All virtues will gather in this child. The great Manu has again come in your dynasty. He will revere and serve Gods and the Brahmins. He will outdistance all those who gone before him.”</p>' +
      '<p>Dharmaraja was still not satisfied. He asked, “I am happy with all the answers you have given. But, I would like to know how he will meet his end.”  The Pundits set about the calculations again and took a long time over it. Finally, they announced, “This prince will give up his kingdom as a result of a sage’s curse. He will be bitten by a serpent.”</p>' +
      '<p>After hearing this, Dharmaraja was very unhappy. He lamented, “O, the horror of it. Why should this child end up like that?” The Brahmins hastened to console him. “Maharaja”, they said, “There is no reason to grieve. As soon as he learns of the curse, he will give up his kingdom, as well as his wife and children and retire to the bank of the holy Bhagirathi river and surrender himself to the Lord. The great sage Suka, son of Vyasa, will arrive there and initiate him into Atma Jnana (Self-knowledge) through the recital of the glories of Lord Krishna and singing of His praise. Thus, he will spend his last days on the sacred bank of Ganga and breathe his last with the adoration of the Lord. He will not born again, for, through Bhakti Yoga (Path of devotion), he will attain oneness with the Lord.  Hearing this, Dharmaraja was consoled and said, “If so, this is no curse; it is a unique boon!”</p>',
