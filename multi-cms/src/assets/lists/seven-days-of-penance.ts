      textContent: `<p>The story of birth of the Lord, a saint, a prophet or a messenger of God is always very beautiful, completely absorbing and spiritually elevating. 
                Out of all the incarnations, the birth of Sri Krishna is the most beautiful one. This is because He personifies Pure Love. Man has an element of Love in him and it is easy to connect with the Lord who is pure, unsullied Love. 
                Divided into seven parys, is this narration of the wonderful story of Sri Krishna’s birth as told in Srimad Bhagavatam (This is not Bhagavad Gita). Why seven days? King Parikshith listened to the stories of Krishna for seven days and achieved Moksha (liberation). It is said that if you read Sri Sai Satcharitra for seven days all your wishes will come true. Seven is a magical number! There are seven sages (saptha rishi), the are seven hills (saptha giri), there are seven notes (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Da, Ni: saptha swara), there are seven seas (saptha samudram). 
                Seven days of constantly remembering the Lord quickly leads to self-realization. There is even a brand of fast food called ‘777’. You all know about ‘Seven Eleven’!</p>
                <p>Bhagavatam narrates the experiences of those devotees who have come in contact with God (Bhagavan + Bhakta = Bhagavatam).  Reading Bhagavatam cures physical, mental and spiritual illnesses. Listening to it promotes the realization of God.<p/>

      '<h6>Background and Setting the stage</h6>' +

      '<p>Pandavas (five in number) go to war with Kauravas (100 in number) after 13 years, to regain the kingdom they lost in a game of dice. Out of the five Pandavas,  Arjuna and Yudhistra (also known as Dharma Raja) play a very important role in the story of Mahabharata. Lord Sri Krishna becomes the Arjuna’s charioteer. On the Kaurava side,  Dronacharya, the Guru and the Master of Archery and his son Ashwatthama, play an important role. Dronacharya is very much attached to his only son Ashwatthama, treats him as his life breath and protects him as eyelids protect the eye.</p>' +

      '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;During the war, it becomes impossible for the Pandavas to kill Dronacharya as he is invincible due to his mastery of archery. In the war, there was an elephant by name Ashwatthama which gets killed. Krishna asks Yudhistra to say loudly that “Ashwatthama is killed” and followed by “the elephant” softly. Just when Yudhistra completes saying “Ashwatthama is killed”, Krishna blows the conch loudly that the words “the elephant” is not at all heard.  Hearing that Ashwatthama is killed, Dronacharya thinks that his son is killed in the war and he loses his hold on the bow. The bow falls to the ground. At this time, Arjuna sends an arrow and kills Dronacharya. Also, Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna, gets killed by Kauravas when they cleverly surround him from all sides.</p>' +

      '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war was over, when Ashwatthama comes to know about the foul play by which his father Dronacharya was killed, he decides to take revenge by killing all the descendants of Pandavas.  Abhimanyu’s wife Uttara was pregnant at that time. Ashwatthama goes to the house of Abhimanyu and shoots an arrow at Uttara’s womb. But, mysteriously, a spinning wheel comes and grinds the arrow to pieces. Uttara with her fetus was saved. An interesting story begins to develop from here. Please wait for the next installment!.</p>',

      '<p>The embryo, growing in the womb of Uttara,  saw a sharp arrow let off by Aswatthama (Drona’s son) flying towards him, emitting sparks of fury and terror, bent on his destruction. But, at that very moment, he also saw a Person of Brilliant Charm armed with a Terrific Wheel, breaking that death-dealing arrow into a hundred pieces. The royal fetus was filled with wonder and gratitude.</p>' + '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The fetus pondered deeply on the identity of the savior. “Who is he? He must be dwelling with me in this womb. Otherwise, how could he see the arrow at the very moment I saw it? He has a dexterous skill that he could destroy it before it reached me. Can he be my uterine brother? How could he get hold of that wheel? If he is endowed with a wheel, how did I miss having it? No, he is not a mortal. He is Divine.” Thus he grew in the womb, contemplating on that Form.  At the end of the period of gestation, he was born into the world with strange splendor. The child too was very bright; it seemed to watch the lineaments of everyone who fondled it or came before it. It stared into their faces very longingly and lovingly. All were surprised at this strange behavior. Every person who came to it was subjected to this searching examination by the child who seemed determined to trace someone or something, in the world into which it was born. The fact remained that the child was examining all, for some trait or sign which it knew already, and recognize the Form it had in mind. “Pariksha” was the word used by every one for the “quest” the child was engaged in. So, even before the formal naming ceremony, everyone was referring to the child as Parikshith (the one who is enagaged in Pariksha) and the name stayed.</p>' +
      '<p>The child was growing bigger every day and  Subhadra (Krishna’s sister) and Uttara were rejoicing watching the frolics of the child. Meanwhile, Yudhistra (Dharama Raja) consulted the court priest and set an auspicious day for the naming ceremony of the child. Invitations were sent to Kings, Rulers, Scholars, Pundits and prominent citizens. Arjuna went to Sri Krishna and reverentially prayed that He should shower His grace on the child on this occasion. He succeeded in bringing Krishna along when he returned. Sahadeva (one of the Pandavas) a took the child and placed it on a bed of flowers in the Mantap that was erected for the naming ceremony. But, the child rose on all fours and started crawling bravely in spite of the remonstrance of the maids. Apparently, the child wanted to proceed somewhere!</p>' +
      
                      '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The efforts of Sahadeva to stop its journey proved futile. Yudhistra, who was observing its movements with interest said with a smile, “Sahadeva! Do not stand in the way. Leave him alone. Let us see what he does”. The child soon made a bee-line towards the place where Lord Krishna was seated, as if He was a long acquaintance whom he was longing to meet. The child grasped the feet of Krishna and pleaded by his looks, that he may be taken on the lap and fondled.</p>' +
      
                      '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Krishna saw his yearning. He laughed aloud! He graciously bent low and lifted the child on to His lap. Sitting on His lap, the prince was staring at the Lord’s face without even a wink; he did not turn his head this way or that. He just sat and stared. Everyone was amazed at this behavior, so unlike that of a child. Sri Krishna turned to Yudhistra and said, “This fellow has started examining even Me! Well, I must test his behavior a little”. Then the Lord tried to distract the attention of the child by placing a variety of toys in front of him and hiding Himself from the view. But, his attention was not drawn towards any object. He had his eyes fixed inexorably on the Lord and he was seeking the Lord always! Krishna declared, “This is no ordinary child. So, Parikshith is the most appropriate name for him”. At this point, the Brahmins recited relevant passages from the Vedas and women sang auspicious songs. The family preceptor dipped a Navaratna (nine-gem) jewel in honey and wrote the name on the tongue of the child and the naming ceremony came to a happy end.</p>' +
      
                      '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Krishna stayed with the Pandavas for several months after the ceremony. The Pandavas enjoyed the intimacy with Krishna and benefited immensely from the Lord’s teachings every day. Finally, Krishna decided to go back to Dwaraka. Arjuna also decided to go with Krishna to Dwaraka to give Him company during the long journey, assure His safety and then return to Hastinapura. But, Arjuna does not return to Hastinapura for a very long time!',

      '<p>It has been a very long time since Arjuna left along with Lord Krishna to Dwaraka and there was no information from him about his whereabouts.  The Pandavas and mother Kunti were getting worried. Yudhistra’s face was becoming pale with anxiety and constant agitation. Day by day, his face was becoming dimmer and dimmer and he was sinking in agony. Dharmaraja (Yudhistra) told his brothers, “I see ominous things all around. I see only inauspiciousness, ill-fortune and negation of joy. I thought this was my imagination due to my sadness and anxiety. But, I could not succeed and muster up courage and confidence.”</p>' +
      '<p>“To make things worse, I saw some scenes that are contrary to established morals and Dharma. The Courts of Justice in this kingdom have been receiving petitions and pleas regarding wrongs, injustices and misdeeds which make me grieve deeply. I saw some situations which were even worse. Last evening, I saw a mother cow refusing  to nurse and feed her new-born calf! This is quite strange and contrary to nature. I saw some women wantonly loitering in the bazaar. I hoped that they would rush into their homes when they saw me; No. Instead, they started staring at me. They had no reverence for authority. They went on as if I was not in the picture. They continued to talk without restraint to the menfolk. I saw all this with my own eyes. I simply proceeded from that horrid place.”</p>' +
      '<p>“Very near the Raja Bhavan, when I was about to enter, I saw a Brahmin selling milk and curds! I saw people emerging out of their houses and closing the doors behind them. I found them fixing an iron thing to the doors so that it can’t be opened. (They were locking the doors for fear of thieves.) My mind was very much concerned with all these tragic transformations.”</p>' +
      '<p>“For, how else are we to explain such a fact as this: a wife quarreled with her husband and is arguing before the judge in court that she should be permitted to go to her parents, leaving him to himself. How I am to face such a plea in court that she should be permitted to dissolve the marriage and leave for her parent’s home, deserting her husband? A petition from such a wife was admitted yesterday in the Court of Justice! How am I to ignore such disgraces?”</p>' +
      '<p>“Yesterday, the horses in the royal stables started weeping. They were shedding copious tears, the workers in the stables reported. These are the indications of wholesale destruction, not of any minor danger or small evil.”</p>' +
      '<p>Meanwhile, a guard from the main entrance rushed in, announcing that the soldiers had spotted Arjuna approaching the outskirts of the city.</p>',

      textContent: '<p>Arjuna was walking briskly and he was quickly approaching the Royal apartment. Everyone rose as if they had suddenly come to life; they hurried forward to meet Arjuna, thirsty for the news from Dwaraka. Arjuna came in, depressed and despondent devoid of any joy. Without looking at anyone, he fell at the feet of Dharmaraja and tears started streaming from Arjuna’s eyes. Nobody had the courage to ask Arjuna about the happenings in Dwaraka.</p>' +
      '<p>Dharmaraja mustered some courage and asked Arjuna in pathetic tone, “Have you any news about Lord Krishna and the Yadavas?” Arjuna with sobbing eyes said, “Brother, Sri Krishna has departed from this world. The Yadavas left the world even before news came of His departure.”</p>' +
      '<p>At this Dhramaraja exclaimed, “Hari, Hari, O God! What is it that you said now? What a catastrophe? I do not understand anything.” Dharmaraja hugged Arjuna and sobbed. All the Pandava brothers were thrown into deep sorrow. He continued, “The Lord causes beings to create beings and He causes beings to end beings. Bodies get born, bodies die. Nothing more happens at birth or death. This has been taught to us by Vaasudeva (Krishna).”</p>' +
      '<p>Hearing what had happened to Krishna, mother Kunti fainted and breathed last. Dharmaraja and Arjuna felt that there is no point in living in this world when the Lord has left the earth. Bhima, Nakula and Sahadeva also had the same feeling.  They all decided to go the Himalayas and work towards their salvation. But, somebody has to hold the reigns of the kingdom. The young boy Parikshith is the only crown prince who has to shoulder the responsibilities of managing the kingdom.</p>' +
      '<p>Dharmaraja called renowned astrologers and asked them, “O wise men, who know the past, present and future! Examine the horoscope of Parikshith and tell me how the future will be shaped.” The Pundits examined the horoscope at length and the head Pundit stood up and addressed King Yudhistra, “Maharaja, I have examined thousands of horoscopes, but I never yet to come across a more auspicious grouping than is indicated in this horoscope. All virtues will gather in this child. The great Manu has again come in your dynasty. He will revere and serve Gods and the Brahmins. He will outdistance all those who gone before him.”</p>' +
      '<p>Dharmaraja was still not satisfied. He asked, “I am happy with all the answers you have given. But, I would like to know how he will meet his end.”  The Pundits set about the calculations again and took a long time over it. Finally, they announced, “This prince will give up his kingdom as a result of a sage’s curse. He will be bitten by a serpent.”</p>' +
      '<p>After hearing this, Dharmaraja was very unhappy. He lamented, “O, the horror of it. Why should this child end up like that?” The Brahmins hastened to console him. “Maharaja”, they said, “There is no reason to grieve. As soon as he learns of the curse, he will give up his kingdom, as well as his wife and children and retire to the bank of the holy Bhagirathi river and surrender himself to the Lord. The great sage Suka, son of Vyasa, will arrive there and initiate him into Atma Jnana (Self-knowledge) through the recital of the glories of Lord Krishna and singing of His praise. Thus, he will spend his last days on the sacred bank of Ganga and breathe his last with the adoration of the Lord. He will not born again, for, through Bhakti Yoga (Path of devotion), he will attain oneness with the Lord.  Hearing this, Dharmaraja was consoled and said, “If so, this is no curse; it is a unique boon!”</p>',

The Pandava brothers showered auspicious sacred rice on the head of Parikshith and started heading in the northerly direction for their salvation. Tears filled the eyes of everyone who witnessed these events.</p>' +
      '<p>Slowly, over time, Parikshith learnt the details, strategies and intricacies of a ruling a kingdom from Kripacharya. At the right age, he got married and had a few children. The citizens of the country were very happy under the rule of king Parikshith.</p>' +
      '<h5>Parikshit Cursed</H5>' +
      '<p>One day, Parikshith went all alone into a forest for hunting. He lost his way, trekked a long distance and could not bag a beast; a fierce thirst began to torment him. He was exhausted beyond endurance. Frantically, he searched for water. Luckily, he found a hermitage, a cottage thatched with grass. When he entered, he found Sage Sameeka in deep meditation. He went near him and addressed, “Sir, Sir, Water!” but Sameeka was deep in meditation. At this, the King was overcome by a fierce gust of anger. His feet trod on some rope on the floor. He discovered it was a snake. Deluded by anger and by a twist of fate, he threw the dead snake around the neck of the hermit and left the hermitage in a hurry to slake his thirst elsewhere.</p>' +
      '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some boys saw him emerge from the cottage and they entered the cottage to find out why he had gone inside. They saw the snake around the neck of Sameeka. They surmised that it must be the handiwork of the man who had just left the hermitage. They ran out and informed Sringi, the son of Sameeka who was playing with his friends. Sringi ran into the cottage and found that the unbelievable had happened. He ran in the direction of the King and threw a handful of water at the King and pronounced the curse: “Let him be bitten by a snake on the seventh day and may he die of that poison”. Meanwhile Sameeka emerged from his deep meditation. He removed the dead snake from his neck and placed it beside him. Sringi told his father, “This was a prank played by a man in the garb of a King. I cursed him that he dies on the seventh day of a snake bite”.</p>' +
      
      '<p>Sameeka was shocked at this news and astonished at the behavior of his son. He knew that the curse could not be taken back. He instructed Sringi to go to King Parikshith’s palace and inform the King of the curse and seek his pardon. Sringi obediently followed the instructions of his father and informed King Pariskhith about the forthcoming danger from the snake. Parikshith knowing that his end is going to come in seven days, left the palace and began to seek sages and saints for spiritual knowledge. Parikshith was not satisfied with the advice many of them gave him.  Finally, he settled under a tree near Bhagirathi river and started to meditate on the Lord.

      textContent: '<h5>Parikshith meets Sage Suka</h5>'+

      '<p>Though Parikshith was trying to meditate, he could not bring his mind to one- pointedness. The fear of impending death was tormenting him. His heart had become soft and tender due to the fate he had to face in a week and the time was slipping away fast. He was shedding tears profusely and sharing his fate with many sages who were present on the banks of Bhagirathi river.</p>'+
      '<p>Meanwhile, a youthful ascetic with an extraordinary bright face and splendor moved through the gathering of the sages, like a fast stream of light and reaching the presence of the king, he seated himself on a sand pedestal. The onlookers were amazed at this sudden appearance. Very soon, one wise old sage recognized him and approached him with folded palms. “Blessed indeed are all of us. This ray of Divine effulgence is coming from no other than Sage Suka, the son of Sage Vyasa”, said the old sage, “From the moment of birth, this person is free from all attachment. He is the master of all knowledge.”</p>'+
      '<p>King Parikshith was gazing with devoted admiration at the face of Sage Suka and said, “Lord, I have a doubt pestering me. Please remove it and give peace to my heart.” Sage Suka interrupted him and said, “King! The reason I have come to you is to end this doubt that is pestering you. I shall resolve your doubt and grant you peace.”</p>'+
      '<p>The King spoke humbly and with great anxiety, “Lord! What should a person facing death, who is aware of the end, engage in? What should his mind dwell upon? After succumbing to death, he should not be born gain. If this is his desire, how should he spend the days at his disposal? This is the problem that is bothering me at present.” “What should I do now?” The King pleaded gain for guidance.</p>'+
      '<p>Sage Suka answered: “King! Withdraw your mind from worldly thoughts and fix it on Hari, the Lord who charms all hearts. There can be no greater spiritual exercise than this.” Suka asked (as if he didn’t know), “O King, please reveal to me who you are and why you are worrying about your death?” At this, the king replied, “Lord, my name is Parikshith. I am the son of Abhimanyu who was killed in the Mahabharata war. I am the grandson of Arjuna, the great warrior.” The king then narrated the curse he had received.</p>'+
      '<p>At the mention of the name Arjuna, Sage Suka’s eyes began to sparkle! “Your grandfather Arjuna and Lord Krishna were very good friends. So, I shall instruct you in the Divine wisdom of Srimad Bhagavtham. Listen to it with all your heart. There is no activity holier than that. It has incorporated in it, every conceivable source of auspiciousness and joy.” Once the other sages heard this, all the sages and king Parikshith sat around Sage Suka below the pedestal to hear the stories.</p>'+
      '<p>Parikshith was curious to know how Arjuna and Krishna became good friends. So, he posed the question, “Swami! How did Arjuna and Krishna meet?” Sage Suka smiled and said, “It is a long story! (Sai Amruta Vani readers don’t have the patience to read these long stories) So, I will tell you a brief version of it. Listen carefully!”</p>'+
      '<p>Krishna and Balaram (Krishna’s elder brother) were present at Draupadi’s Swayamvaram (the festival for choice of bride-groom). Arjuna won Draupadi’s hand by hitting the rotating fish with his bow which was the testing game that Draupadi’s father had set up. Arjuna started walking towards the Palace exit holding Draupadis hand. At that time, Krishna approached Arjuna and said, “I know you - but you do not know Me! I am the son of Vasudeva. My name is Sri Krishna. I am older than you. I recognized that you are one of the Pandava brothers. At last, I am able to meet you. This bride is an embodiment of virtue and intelligence.” This was their first meeting.</p>'+
      '<p>Parikshith asked, “Lord, How did they become thick friends after this first meeting?” “There is more to it” said Sage Suka, “ Vasudeva’s (Krishna’s father) sister is Kunti. Kunti is the mother of Arjuna. So, Kunti is Krishna’s aunt. Arjuna is Krishna’s nephew. Not only that, Subhadra was the daughter of Vasudeva and  Rohini (second wife of Vasudeva). She was born after Krishna and therefore she is Krishna’s younger sister. Arjuna married Subhadra and therefore, Arjuna is Krishna’s bother-in-law. Because of these multiple relationships, Krishna became the dearest friend of Arjuna.”</p>'+
      '<p>Sage Suka started narrating all the stories of Krishna and interesting episodes of Arjuna with Krishna over the next six days. From the stories, Parikshith felt as if he was standing in front of Lord Krishna completely bathed in His Divine grace. Parikshith shed tears of joy when he heard all the sweet stories consecutively for six days.</p>'+
      '<p>At this time, King Parikshith told Sage Suka, “Master! Time is fast approaching its end as far as my body is concerned. Please tell me the story of the birth of Lord as Krishna. May my final hour be blessed by that sacred story.”At this, Sage Suka became very happy and spoke thus: “Maharaja Parikshith, I am also filled with joy at the prospect of spending the few remaining hours in reciting the wondrous birth of Sri Krishna. Only those who are ripe in Bhakthi can grasp its meaning. Others revel in the depths of sin and have no use for it.”</p>'+
      '<h4>AUM NARAYANA VIDMAHEY VASUDEVAYA DHEEMAHI<br/>.....THANTHOE VISHNU PRACHO DAYATU</H4>' +
      '<p><u>Lineage of Sri Krishna’s parents:</u> Maharaja, long long ago, the world was ruled by a Yadu dynasty king named Ahuka. He had two sons Devaka and Ugrasena. When they grew up, the king got them married and they shared the burden of the kingdom. Years slipped by. Devaka had seven daughters and Devaki was the eldest of all. Ugrasena had nine sons and Kamsa was he eldest son. Devaki and Kamsa play a vital role in this story of Sri Krishna. Within the precincts of the capital city of Mathura, there lived a Yadu prince Surasena. He had ten sons and five daughters; the eldest son was Vasudeva and the eldest daughter was Kunthi.</p>'+
      
      '<p>Devaki, the daughter of Kamsa’s paternal uncle was given in marriage to Vasudeva; the marriage was celebrated on a grand scale. Kamsa had no sisters of his own and so he loved Devaki as his dearest self.Kamsa showered Devaki with costly raiments, and precious jewels and took special interest in pompous hospitality to everyone. On the third day, the bride has to be sent to the groom’s home and Kamsa himself drove the newly-weds in a magnificent chariot.</p>'+
      
      '<p><u>The thundering prophecy and Kamsa’s anger:</u>  Suddenly, there was a brilliant lightning flash and a terrific sound over the chariot. Everyone froze into pillars of immobility. All the music was silenced in an instant. Through the sky the following words exploded: “O, Kamsa! This very sister whom you love as your own self so affectionately – her eighth child will deal you death! Reflect on that coming calamity!” and the shining figure disappeared from the sky.</p>'+
      
      '<p>Kamsa lost control of himself, the reins fell off his grasp and was filled with fury. His thoughts took a decisive turn. With the sister alive, the killer will be born; with the sister killed, no one can deal him death! Kamsa lifted Devaki from her seat by her plaited hair and pulled the sword out of the scabbard with the intention of slicing her head off. What an awful sight was this! He should attempt to kill the very sister he loved so long deeply and whom he was escorting! No one dared to avert this disaster.</p>'+
      
      '<p><u>Vasudeva pleads:</u>  Meanwhile, Vasudeva rose and held both the hands of Kamsa tight in his grasp. “Dear brother-in-law! I too heard the voice from the sky. We do not like any harm come to you. For a man like you, it is not proper to indulge in such cruel acts. Release your sister from the hold. If you firmly believe in the voice from the sky, I assure you that I shall entrust to your care every child that is born of her. While my offer is there, if you still slaughter your sister, you will suffer from this monstrous sin”. When Vasudeva pleaded like this, Kamsa said, “Well! Be warned! Keep up the word you have given me”. He asked his brother to take charge of the chariot and returned to his palace.</p>'+
      
      '<p><u>Time passes:</u>  In due course, Devaki became pregnant, nine months passed and she delivered a son. As promised, Vasudeva handed over the new-born babe, rolled in warm clothing to the tender mercies of Kamsa. However, Kamsa had no mind to kill the tender baby. He said, “Dear brother-in-law, this babe can cause no harm to me! It is the eighth child! Please take back this child!” Devaki was extremely happy that her first born was restored to her. She poured her heart out in gratitude to God for this blessing.</p>'+
      
      '<p><u>Narada creates confusion:</u>  Meanwhile, sage Narada came to Kamsa’s court and enquired about Kamsa and his kingdom. During the course of the conversation, Narada said, “So, it is the eighth child that is going to kill you. Is it the eighth child counting from the first born or the last born or from the middle? Do not disregard death as a distant contingency!” With these parting wordsNarada left the palace.</p>'+
      
      '<p><u>Kamsa’s anger:</u> Narada’s words were like poking a dagger into a bleeding wound. Kamsa flew into a rage and sent word for Vasudeva. He roared, “How many children you have now?”Vasudeva’s lips quivered as he replied, “Now I have six!” Kamsa yelled, “Tomorrow morning bring all six and hand them over to me.” Vasudeva walked like a corpse, went to Devaki, held her in tight embrace and broke the sad news. Next morning, Vasudeva handed over all the six children unwillingly to Kamsa and burst into tears. The ego centric maniac caught hold of each of them by the leg and beat them out of shapeon the hard floor! Meanwhile, the seventh pregnancy! Surprisingly, it was aborted in the seventh month! When Kamsa came to knew about this, he thought that Devaki was capable of some strategy to deceive him. So, he put both of them in a closely guarded prison.</p>',

      '<p><u>The Divine pregnancy:</u> At this point, Sage Suka moistened his lips with his tongue and continued: Devaki and Vasudeva being in prison, looked like mad persons. They sat with unkempt hair, lean and lanky due to lack of appetite and no means to feed their bodies. They could not sleep and they were consumed by grief over the children they had lost. After another year, Devaki conceived for the eighth time. O, it was wondrous! What a transformation it had brought about!</p>' +
      
       
      
      '<p><u>The wonderful transformation: </u>The faces of Devaki and Vasudeva, which had drooped and dried up, suddenly blossomed like lotuses in full bloom. They shone with a strange splendor. Their bodies which were reduced to mere skin and bone, took on flesh, became round and smooth and shone with a charming golden hue. The prison cell of Devaki and Vasudeva became fragrant with pleasing odors; it cast a wondrous light and was filled with inexplicable music and jingling of dancing feet. Devaki and Vasudeva became aware of these happenings, but they were afraid to inform Kamsa, lest in his vindictive frenzy, he might hack the womb to pieces. They were anxious about the strange future of the son to be born and were restless with weird forebodings.</p>' +
      
       
      
      '<p><u>Kamsa’s meanness and Pariskshith’s question:</u> Kamsa knew his time was fast approaching; he was torn by greed to continue as an unquestioned Emperor; he was overcome by conspiracy; he overran the territories of Yadu, Vrishni, Bhoja and Andaka and added them to his domain; he threw his father Ugrasena into prison; thereafter, his will was sovereign. Hearing these words of Suka, Parikshith said, “What foolishness is this? Knowing fully well that his end was drawing near, should he not give up his greed and turn his mind towards God?” Suka burst into laughter and said, “Maharaja! You think that all those whose end is near will utilize the time at their disposal to seek the vision of the Lord! Such yearning can arise in the mind only due to good deeds performed in the previous lives. Those who have acquired good merits from their past actions, have compassion towards all beings, do not swerve from the right path and adhere to truth, non-violence and love. They have only thoughts of God and urge to do sanctifying deeds till their last days. Instead, those who are immersed in selfishness, egotism, greed, vice, violence and unrighteousness will suffer from increased evil urges in their last days and destroy themselves. Hence the saying Vinaasa Kaale, Vipareetha Buddhi.”</p>' +
      
       
      
      '<p><u>Suka continues: </u>The fetus of the seventh pregnancy was taken from Devaki and transferred to Rohini who was in Gokula under the protection of Nanda. This was done so that the child may grow into a companion and helpmate for Krishna. Rohini gave birth to a son who was named as Balarama because of his extraordinarily strong body and his charming innocence and intelligence. Since he was transferred from the womb of Devaki to Rohini, he was also called Samkarshana (who was attracted or drawn). Meanwhile, the eighth pregnancy completed nine months; Devaki and Vasudeva sat helpless in great anguish without food or sleep fearing what would Kamsa do next. Kamsa took extra precautions to see that the child does not escape him. He ordered that Vasudeva and Devaki be shackled with chains on hand and feet. But, who can hinder the inscrutable operation of the will of God?</p>' +
      
       
      
      '<p><u>The advent of the Lord:</u> One night, Devaki developed labor pains; with her mind firmly fixed on God, she was looking at the oil lamp in the cell, asking herself, “What is going to happen to me?” Suddenly, the flame went out and darkness filled the cell. Just then, there was an effulgent Form with a strange splendor standing before her. Gradually, the Form became clear! It was armed with the Conch, the Discus and the Mace; the fourth hand was held in Abhaya pose.It said softly and sweetly, “Do not fear! I am Narayana. I am to be born in a few minutes as your son in an answer to the promise I made as a result of your earnest prayers. I will be known as Krishna and also as Vasudeva. As soon as I am born, the shackles will fall off from your hands and feet. The doors of the prison will open by themselves. Take Me from here without anyone’s knowledge, to the home of Nanda in Gokula. Place Me by the side of his wife, Yasoda who is having labor pains now. Bring the baby girl that Yasoda has delivered back into this prison and keep her with you. Then, send word to Kamsa. Until he gets the news, no one either in Mathura or Gokula will notice you. I shall arrange it so.” Blessing Devaki and Vasudeva, the effulgent Form entered the womb of Devaki as an Orb of Light. Within minutes the Divine Child was born! It was 3:30AM. The shackles that bound the hands and feet of Vasudeva fell off in a trice. The doors and the gates flew open. Though it was still dark, a cuckoo was cooing with a sudden spurt of joy. The Rain-God was showering flower drops of rain on the earth. Around the prison, flocks of bird clustered in happy song, twittering sweet melody. Vasudeva turned his eyes towards the new born child and was astounded. Encircling the Babe was a brilliant halo of Light!</p>' +
      
       
      
      '<p><u>The Lord moves to Gokul:</u> Vasudeva did not delay. He spread an old dhoti on a bamboo basket and placed the Babe on it. He tore an old sari of Devaki and covered the Babe and placed the basket on his head. He moved out of the open doors and gates, past the sleeping guards. He noticed the little drops of rain that was falling on the Babe and was afraid that the Babe would be soaked. But, when he turned back, he found a snake following his footsteps, holding the ribbed umbrella of its broad hoods over the child preventing the rain from wetting the Babe. He soon realized that it was Adisesha protecting the Lord. Though the sun had not risen yet, the lotus bloomed in all the tanks and leaned on its stalk towards the Babe. Though it was a dark night, with a deep yearning to look at the Babe, the full moon peeped through the clouds, with its cool rays illuminating the entire route to Gokul. Vasudeva began to cross Yamuna river to reach Gokul. The water was rising very rapidly above Vasudeva’s head and he was afraid that he would drown. It dawned on him that Yamuna was paying its respects to the Lord by wetting the feet of the Babe! The Babe was placed next to Yashoda and the baby girl that had just been born there was brought and placed into the hands of Devaki. No sooner this was done, Vasudeva burst into tears!While these words were coming from Suka’s lips, Parikshith exclaimed aloud, “Krishna, Krishna!” Everyone looked at the King. They saw a snake crawling away fast, after biting the right toe of the King. Suka shed tears of Bliss; He announced, “The King has merged with the Lord”. The word Suka means parrot. Yes, he was the parrot that plucked the ripe nectar filled fruit called Bhagavatha from the tree of the Vedas and enabled the world to taste it. May the world relish the fruit and derive the Atmic Bliss! Jai Sai Ram!S</p>'+

      textContent: '<h5>How did Devaki become Krishna’s mother?</h5>' + 

      '<p>Devaki in her previous birth was a very pious woman and always thinking of Lord Narayana. After many years of her prayer, Lord Narayana appeared before her and asked what she wanted. She could have asked for Moksha then and there. However, since she was always thinking of God, her selfish needs did not surface to her mind. She felt that her body should be useful to humanity. So, she asked Lord Narayana, “Please give me the boon so that you will be born in my womb”. Lord Narayana granted her boon saying that in her next birth He will be born to her. She thought that she could love the Lord even more because as a baby, she could nurse Him, fondle Him with love, feed Him, bathe Him, clothe Him and play with Him.</p>' +
      
      '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As destined, baby Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudeva in the prison at the early morning hours. As instructed by the Lord, the baby had to be transported to Gokul and placed beside Yashoda, before dawn. Devaki did not get to a chance to fondle baby Krishna but Yashoda had the great fortune of bringing up Krishna. As you can see, the Lord gave her the boon exactly as she requested: “Please give me the boon so that you will be born in my womb”. One must be very careful when asking God for a boon! Look at the sacrifice that Devaki has done to mankind! Without the advent of Krishna, humanity would not have turned towards God.</p>'+
      
       
      
      '<h5>Who is Sage Suka?</h5>' + 
      
      '<p>Sage Suka was waiting for Parikshith to approach him to impart this Divine Knowledge. Suka was the son of Sage Vyasa. Vyasa classified the Vedas, composed Puranas, Mahabharata and gave the world Bhagavatam. He also gave Bhagavad Gita and Brahma Sutras. Vyasa was the son of Sage Parasara and great grandson on Sage Vasishta. Sage Suka came from Vasudeva, recounted the story of Vasudeva to Parikshith and finally merged in Lord Vasudeva. Sage Suka, after God realization, took pity on humanity and helped humanity by establishing the practice of  NamaSmarana (repetition of the Lord’s name). The sweetness of NamaSmarana evokes God’s Form and His Grace. Suka gave this precious gem to mankind.</p>'+
      
       
      '<h5>Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa’s comments on Sage Suka:</h5>'+
      
      '<p>What Brahman (Ultimate  Reality or God) is cannot be described. Even he, who knows Brahman, cannot describe it. There is a saying that a boat, once reaching the "black waters" of the ocean cannot come back. When "I" (ego) drops completely, one attains the Knowledge of Brahman (God realization occurs) and there is no coming back!  Suka returned to the world of name and form, even after attaining the Knowledge of Brahman, for the purpose of teaching others. He had to recite the Bhagavatam to King Parikshith and had to teach people the power of Nama Smarana. Therefore, God did not destroy his "I" altogether. God kept in him the "ego of knowledge". Note: Only after reciting of the Bhagavatam to King Parikshith did his "I" disappear altogether and he merged with the Lord Vasudeva. And, so did King Parikshith after the snake bite. The power of Bhagavatam is that, the one who recites it with devotion and the one who listens to it with Bhakthi, both reach Lord Vasudeva!</p>'+
      
       
            '<h5>EPILOGUE</h5>' + 
      
            '<p>I hope you could find time to read Sri Krishna\'s story and enjoy it. As the Lord has said, "Whenever you shed tears in repentance for the sins you have committed or whenever you shed tears of joy by hearing or reading about the glories of Me, be assured that some of your Karmas are being washed away". I hope your tears of joy wiped out some of your past Karmas and sprouted love in your heart to seek the Lord with even more devotion. That was the very purpose for which this story was presented to all of you.  May the Lord’s blessings be upon you and your family!<p/>' +
