            '<p>Krishna was the eighth son of Devaki and Vasudeva. The fetus of the seventh son Balarama was transferred to the womb of Rohini and he was brought up in Gokul. Devaki’s father was Devaka and his elder brother Ugrasena was ruling over Mathura. Ugrasena had nine sons and Kamsa was the eldest son. Kamsa had no sisters of his own and so he loved Devaki as his dearest self. Kamsa imprisoned his father Ugrasena and installed himself as the King of Mathura.</p><p>Jarasandha ruled over Magadha. He gave his two daughters Asti and Prapti in marriage to Kamsa. Krishna killed Kamsa in a fight and restored the crown to Ugrasena. Krishna refused to take the crown, handed over Mathura to Ugrasena and went back to Dwaraka. Jarasandha hated Krishna because both his daughters were widowed by Krishna.</p><p>Jarasandha’s friend Damaghosha was a king of Chedi. He was very cruel and a stubborn King. (Dama means curbing down. Ghosha means famous. So, he was famous for curbing down and controlling his citizens.) He had a son Sishupala who will be the crown prince of Chedi. Damaghosha loved his son so much that he would many perform many rituals to invoke good fortune on him.</p>' +
            '<h4>Rukmi brings the news</h4><p>Bheeshmaka was the King of Vidharba. He had five sons and only one daughter. The first son was Rukmi and the youngest daughter was Rukmini. She was very beautiful and was at the right age to be married. Narada used to visit Bhishmaka’s palace often and from their conversations she had heard many good things about Krishna. Slowly, Rukmini started thinking of Krishna and began to dote on Krishna.</p><p>Rukmini’s brother Rukmi was always in bad company and he was very friendly with Kamsa and  Jarasandha. Rukmi brought the news to Bheeshmaka that the cowherd boy Krishna had slain Kamsa.<br/>Rukmini said, “He is not a cowherd boy. He is a noble Yadava.”<br/>Rukmi snapped immediately, “Rukmini, he has killed my friend and you call him noble?”<br/>“Don’t forget! Kamsa was cruel. He imprisoned his own father and usurped the throne”, shouted Rukmini.<br/>Bheeshmaka interrupted, “I assume Krishna will now become the King of Mathura.”<br/>Rukmi said, “No. Krishna refused the crown and Ugrasena was re-instated.”<br/>Rukmini cut him short, “Don’t you see! How noble Krishna is?”<br/>“How did Jarasandha react?” asked Bheeshmaka.<br/>Rukmi replied, “He is furious. He vows to take revenge. He has sent word for me. I must go and see him.”</p>' +
            '<h4>Rukmini longs for Krishna</h4><p>All this news and incidents made Rukmini’s love for Krishna even stronger. Bheeshmaka and his wife also felt that Krishna was the most suitable groom for Rukmini.<br/>Meanwhile, Jarasandha with Rukmi and his allies made several attempts to kill Krishna but in vain. After the eighteenth attempt, they decided to bide their time and go back to their capitals.<br/>In Dwaraka, Balarama broke the news: “Krishna, we have come to know that Jarasandha has decided to lie low for a while. Now, you will have some time to think of the beautiful princess of Vidharba!”<br/>“Balarama! Somehow, I have also developed love for Rukmini. I am thinking of her all the time! My mind is also set on marrying her. But her brother Rukmi is a staunch ally of Jarasandha.”<br/>At the same time, in Vidharba, Rukmini too was lost in the dreams of Krishna hugging her (when the Lord thinks of His devotee, the devotee also thinks of Him!). She thought, “Even with Rukmi and his allies, Jarasandha could not vanquish Krishna. You are great, Krishna! You and only You shall be my Lord!”<p><h4>To be continued….</h4>',

              textContent: '<h4>Bheeshmaka’s proposal refused</h4><p>When Rukmi returned from the war, Bheeshmaka called him and said,“Rukmi, your mother and I have decided to give Rukmini in marriage to Krishna.”Rukmi quickly responded, “How could you do it father? Krishna has killed Jarasanda’s son-in-law, Kamsa. We cannot afford to displease this mighty emperor.”Bheeshmaka’s face dropped: “But, we cannot think of a better husband for Rukmini.”Rukmi said, “My friend Sishupala, the crown prince of Chedi is enamored of Rukmini.  He will be the best person to marry her.”Bheeshmaka was not at all happy about it but he had to yield to his eldest son’s decisions. Not only that, he was getting old and he could not think of ways to bring Krishna and Rukmini together. He said, “All right Rukmi, do as you will!”Rukmi said, “Then, I shall send a proposal to the King of Chedi and invite Sishupala to come and marry Rukmini.”Rukmini who was walking in the garden, overheard their conversation and was deeply upset. She thought, “How can my brother force me to marry someone whom I don’t like?” Meanwhile, Rukmi started making arrangements for Rukmini’s marriage with Sishupala.</p>' + 
              '<h4>Rukmni sends a love letter</h4><p>Suddenly, a thought occurred to Rukmini.“Why not I approach Krishna? After all, my parents are for it.”She went into the palace to her room and sent word for Sunanda, a brahmin whom she trusted and who was also kind to her.Sunanda walked in and said surprisingly, “Why do you look so pale dear? What is the matter?”Rukmini told him about the conversation she had overheard and asked him, “Is it wrong to send a secret message to Krishna?”Sunanda replied, “No dear! It would be very wrong to marry Sishupala if your heart is set on another. Moreover, your parents have approved Krishna and their hearts are set on Him.”Rukmini asked him, “With whom can I entrust such a sacred message?”“Don’t worry dear one! I shall carry the message for you.”Rukmini took a banana leaf and wrote a message on it using  her nails and gave it to Sunanda saying, “Be sure to tell Krishna that my kith and kin should not be killed on my account.” Sunanda assured that he would do so.</p>'  +
              '<h4>Krishna reads the letter</h4><p>With great difficulty, Sunanda reached Dwaraka and met Krishna. Krishna welcomed him, seated him and said, “O venerable one, please tell me why have you come this far?”Sunanda said, “Dear Lord, I have come with a message from Rukmini, the princess of Vidarbha!”Sunanda described Rukmini’s dilemma and gave the message to Krishna. Krishna lovingly received the banana leaf from the hands of Sunanda and started reading the message:“Lord, I have chosen You as my husband. Please come to Vidarbha, vanquish the armies of Jarasandha and Sishupla and take me with you. On the day of the marriage, I will be first taken to the Durga temple for worship. It will be a good place for you to kidnap me from there.”<br/>After reading the message, Krishna looked at Sunanda."If you do not come and take her away, she has decided to give up her life!”, said Sunanda.<br/>Krishna replied, “I know… I know. Little does she know that I too have set my heart on winning her! But Rukmi will not give her to me.”<br/>Sunanda’s face fell, “That means…. you will not take her….”<br/>“No. No. Now that she has revealed her heart to me, I shall make her mine. I shall vanquish anyone who comes in my way”, said Krishna.<br/>At this point, Sunanda interrupted, “The little girl wants to make sure that there is no blood-shed on her account.” Krishna nodded His head in approval, gave gifts to Sunanda and sent him home.</p>' +
              '<h4>Krishna heads to Vidarbha/Jarasandha plans</h4><p>Krishna called his charioteer Daruka and asked him to get ready. Krishna told him to inform Balarama that he was proceeding to Vidarbha. Meanwhile, Rukmi’s formal proposal and invitation reached Sishupala. Sishupala was very jubilant because there was no Swayamvara (bride choosing the husband). All he has to do was, go to Vidarbha marry Rukmini and bring her home. It was that easy.. but Jarasandha was not confident. He knew that the vile cowherd could cause some trouble if he comes to know of this news. Jarasandha sent for all his vassals and allies to be ready in Vidarbha to confront Krishna, if he comes to take away the bride.  Balarama became aware of this news and marched towards Vidarbha with his armies, elephants, horses and chariots.</p>'
              + '<h4>Rukmini’s anxiety builds up</h4><p>At Vidarbha, Rukmini’s anxiety was building up every moment. She thought, “Has Krishna felt disgusted with my message that I have no shame in asking him to be my husband? Then, why has Sunanda not come back?” As she started looking at the window for the hundredth time, she saw Sunanda entering the palace. She quickly ran to the door to meet Sunanda. Sunanda briefed her, “Krishna has come dear! Everything is going according to the plan. Balarama too has come with his forces” and left the palace in a hurry.</p>' +
              '<h4>Rukmini heads to Durga’s shrine</h4><p>“Rukmini, your chariot has arrived. Are you ready?”, shouted one of the maids. Rukmini was dressed nicely and she got into the chariot. She was taken to the temple courtyard where she stepped down. Many Kings had assembled there. From there, she looked for Krishna and thought, “I don’t see Krishna among them. They say that he is dark blue, wears a yellow robe and sports a peacock feather in his crown.” She entered the temple, washed the feet of Goddess Durga, and placed flowers at her feet. Overcome by anxiety and emotion, she prayed, “O Goddess Durga, please let Krishna and only Krishna win and marry me. O Durga, please do not disappoint me.” As she walked towards the gate, her eyes scanned the assembly of Kings again,  looking for Krishna. She murmured, “Will Krishna ever come and rescue me?”</p>'

It is me! Your Krishna!” In a moment, she was placed in the chariot next to Him and Krishna’s chariot sped away blowing dust into the eyes of the confused Kings. Jarasandha ordered his army to pursue Krishna. Balarama immediately came behind Krishna’s chariot and assured Krishna that he will deal with them.</p>' + '<h4>Rukmi follows Krishna</h4>' +
              '<p>While Balarama was dealing with Jarasandha and his army, Rukmi and Shishupala charged ahead towards Krishna’s chariot. Balarama engaged in a fierce fight with Shishupala. Shishupala slowed down lost Krishna. Meanwhile, Rukmi had almost caught up with Krishna. Rukmi shot an arrow at Krishna which only hit his armor. Krishna then killed Rukmi’s horses with his arrows and then shattered his chariot. Mad with rage, Rukmi took his sword and rushed towards Krishna. Krishna picked up his sword and was ready to fight. Immediately, Rukmini fell at Krishna’s feet and cried, “O Dear Lord, please spare my brother. Please do not kill him!”</p>' + 
              '<h4>Rukmi humiliated</h4>' + 
              '<p>Krishna said, “Arise Rukmini! For your sake, Rukmi shall live.” Krishna went up to Rukmi and tied him with his cummerbund. Krishna then with his sword, shaved half of Rukmi’s mustache and shaved half of his head. Just then Balarama arrived and he talked to Rukmini,“Please do not take offence, dear sister-in-law. Your brother has reaped the fruits of his own actions.” Humiliated and insulted, Rukmi walked away saying, “I can’t return to the capital now. It is a shame.”</p>' + 
              '<h4>Rukmini weds Krishna in Dwaraka</h4>' + 
              '<p>Krishna said, “Come into the chariot Rukmini. We must hurry to Dwaraka and have our wedding solemnized by rituals.” After a few days, they were married according to Vedic rituals. After this marriage, Krishna became the King of Yadus at Dwaraka. The inhabitants of Dwaraka City were so pleased that they dressed themselves with nicest garments and ornaments and went to present gifts, according to their means, to the newly married couple. All the houses of Dwaraka were decorated with flags, festoons and flowers.  The whole city became fragrant by burning of fine incense. At night, there was illumination from thousands of lamps, which decorated every building. The Goddess of fortune Rukmini, was finally united with the Lord Krishna and all the people of Dwaraka felt extremely jubilant.',fullFileName: `assets/all-images/religion/kanha-rukhmini/HanumanAugust62022.jpeg`,
