    `<H2>A Treasure chest of spiritual words: quotes and stories </H2>
      <p>
          </em> <h5><strong>The Start: &nbsp;"Amrutvani.. Sai Amrutvani"</strong></h5><em>
          A once regular at the Shirdi Sai Temple in Milpitas, along with the bliss experienced at 'Mini Shirdi', I met some truly wonderful people:
          <br/><b>Mr Jayasimha Prasad</b>, someone I can identify as a modern day Hemadpant * along with other exceptional qualities.
          <br/>Prasad sir started 'Sai Amrutvani' (literal translation 'Words or Voice of Nectar'), a Yahoo! group distribution list on August 10 2010.
          He'd glean and search different sources to find profound sayings, narrations of stories and other snippets relevant to spirituality and love. 
          He developed a knack of posting something so relevant at that point of time!!! Evident that he was being guided by a Supreme force...
          Sadly, Yahoo!groups disbanded and he had to discontinue distribution some time in 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>The content is generally of two kinds - individual(independen) quotes by Gurus and famous personalities, and narratives, or stories</li>
          <li>(Bit technical here; please bear with me) These sayings, etc are already hosted, using 'legacy code' on a separate website, using the predecessor of the 
          Angular Typescript Framework - AngularJS and JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
          <h5>History:<strong>Apt Time Frame of January 19-22, 2024: Initial Launch</strong></h5>
          <ul>
          <li> January 22nd is the inauguration of the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya.. A major 'Sanatani' event, I have targeted launch.</li>
          <li> During significant Auspicious times like 'Navratri', Prasad ji would email-distribute a story across different days.</li>
          <li> Thus for the initial launch, I intend 'Sundara Kaandam' - an extract of the epic Ramayan</li>
          </ul>
          Hope you enjoy and absorb these pearls and gain from them!!
